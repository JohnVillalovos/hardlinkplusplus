WHAT IT DOES:
hardlink++ will recurse through all the directories you specify and try to find
files which can be hardlinked together to save disk space.  This is most useful
when you are a mirror for ftp sites.  Many times there will be duplicate
packages on a mirror site and this can be a great savings of disk space

HOW:
This is a rewrite of the hardlink.c code using C++ and the STL.  At the moment
it doesn't use any object oriented programming techniques.

WHY:
The main reason I did this is that I liked what the hardlink.c code did but did
not like the code itself.  To me it was very unmaintainable.  So I converted
hardlink.c to hardlink.cpp.
